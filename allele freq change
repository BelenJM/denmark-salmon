# calculate allele freq either using freq or counts
# in this case, we use counts from vcftools (counts2 option outputs just the counts)
# with --counts we can check which allele is which (for checking purposes)

vcftools --vcf 5e5.SK2015.recode.vcf --counts --out 5e5.SK2015
# output: 5e5.SK2015.frq.count
